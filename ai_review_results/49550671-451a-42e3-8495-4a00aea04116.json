    "lay_summary": "Understanding How Rapamycin Might Help Us Live Longer\n\nScientists are studying a drug called rapamycin to see if it can help extend lifespan and improve health as we age. Rapamycin was originally discovered as an antifungal compound from bacteria found on Easter Island, but researchers later found it has remarkable effects on aging in laboratory animals.\n\nThis research aims to understand how rapamycin affects longevity - essentially, how long animals live and how healthy they remain as they age. Previous studies have shown that rapamycin can extend lifespan in mice, flies, and other laboratory animals, sometimes by 10-15%. Scientists believe rapamycin works by affecting cellular pathways that control growth and metabolism, particularly one called mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin).\n\nAnimal studies are essential for this research because aging is a complex biological process that involves multiple organ systems working together over time. We cannot fully understand how a drug affects lifespan and age-related health without observing these processes in living organisms. Laboratory animals allow researchers to control environmental factors and study the drug's effects systematically.\n\nIn this study, researchers will give rapamycin to laboratory animals and monitor their health and lifespan over time. They will track various health markers and compare treated animals to untreated control groups. The goal is to better understand how rapamycin works and whether its anti-aging effects could eventually benefit human health.\n\nThis research could lead to new treatments that help people live longer, healthier lives by slowing down the aging process itself.",

    "assembly": "# COMPLETE IACUC PROTOCOL DOCUMENT\n\n**Protocol Title:** Effects of Rapamycin on Longevity\n**Principal Investigator:** Ravi Tolwani\n**Protocol Status:** INCOMPLETE - MAJOR REVISIONS REQUIRED\n\n## 1. PROJECT SUMMARY (LAY SUMMARY)\n\nUnderstanding How Rapamycin Might Help Us Live Longer\n\nScientists are studying a drug called rapamycin to see if it can help extend lifespan and improve health as we age. Rapamycin was originally discovered as an antifungal compound from bacteria found on Easter Island, but researchers later found it has remarkable effects on aging in laboratory animals.\n\nThis research aims to understand how rapamycin affects longevity - essentially, how long animals live and how healthy they remain as they age. Previous studies have shown that rapamycin can extend lifespan in mice, flies, and other laboratory animals, sometimes by 10-15%. Scientists believe rapamycin works by affecting cellular pathways that control growth and metabolism, particularly one called mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin).\n\nAnimal studies are essential for this research because aging is a complex biological process that involves multiple organ systems working together over time. We cannot fully understand how a drug affects lifespan and age-related health without observing these processes in living organisms. Laboratory animals allow researchers to control environmental factors and study the drug's effects systematically.\n\nIn this study, researchers will give rapamycin to laboratory animals and monitor their health and lifespan over time. They will track various health markers and compare treated animals to untreated control groups. The goal is to better understand how rapamycin works and whether its anti-aging effects could eventually benefit human health.\n\nThis research could lead to new treatments that help people live longer, healthier lives by slowing down the aging process itself.\n\n## 2.

STATISTICAL JUSTIFICATION\n\n# STATISTICAL REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n## CRITICAL ASSESSMENT\n\n**MAJOR CONCERN: INADEQUATE SAMPLE SIZE**\n\nThe current protocol originally requested only **1 animal** for a longevity study investigating rapamycin effects. This represents a fundamental statistical and scientific flaw that renders the study scientifically invalid and ethically unjustifiable.\n\n## POWER ANALYSIS JUSTIFICATION\n\nBased on standard parameters for longevity research:\n- **Test Type**: Two-sample t-test (treatment vs. control)\n- **Effect Size**: 0.8 (large effect, typical for longevity interventions)\n- **Statistical Power**: 80% (standard requirement)\n- **Alpha Level**: 0.05 (standard significance threshold)\n- **Groups**: 2 (rapamycin treatment vs. control)\n\n**RESULTS**: \n- **Minimum required per group**: 25 animals\n- **Total animals needed**: 50 animals\n- **With 20% attrition adjustment**: **63 animals**\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF ORIGINAL ANIMAL NUMBERS\n\n**VERDICT: COMPLETELY INADEQUATE**\n\nThe originally requested 1 animal was:\n- **Scientifically invalid**: Cannot detect meaningful differences\n- **Statistically underpowered**: 0% power to detect effects\n- **Ethically problematic**: Wastes animal life without scientific value\n- **Regulatory non-compliant**: Fails to meet basic research standards\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: MAJOR REVISION REQUIRED** - Protocol must be revised to include minimum 63 animals with appropriate statistical design.\n\n## 6.
