    "lay_summary": "Scientists are studying two different approaches that might help people live longer, healthier lives. This research compares a drug called rapamycin with a dietary practice called intermittent fasting to see which works better for extending both lifespan and healthspan (the period of life spent in good health).\n\nThe study uses laboratory mice because they share many biological similarities with humans but have much shorter lifespans, allowing researchers to observe complete life cycles within a reasonable timeframe. Using mice is essential because this type of long-term study cannot be conducted safely or ethically in humans first.\n\nFour hundred mice will be divided into five groups over twelve months. One group will eat normally as a control. Two groups will receive different doses of rapamycin, a drug that affects cellular aging processes. Another group will practice intermittent fasting, going without food for 24 hours three times each week. The final group will receive both rapamycin and intermittent fasting.\n\nThroughout the study, researchers will monitor the mice's health and record how long they live. They want to determine whether rapamycin, intermittent fasting, or a combination of both approaches is most effective at promoting healthy aging.\n\nThis research could lead to new treatments or lifestyle recommendations for humans. Understanding how these interventions affect aging might help develop strategies to extend not just how long people live, but how many of those years are spent in good health, free from age-related diseases.",

PROJECT SUMMARY (LAY SUMMARY)\n\nScientists are studying two different approaches that might help people live longer, healthier lives. This research compares a drug called rapamycin with a dietary practice called intermittent fasting to see which works better for extending both lifespan and healthspan (the period of life spent in good health).\n\nThe study uses laboratory mice because they share many biological similarities with humans but have much shorter lifespans, allowing researchers to observe complete life cycles within a reasonable timeframe. Using mice is essential because this type of long-term study cannot be conducted safely or ethically in humans first.\n\nFour hundred mice will be divided into five groups over twelve months. One group will eat normally as a control. Two groups will receive different doses of rapamycin, a drug that affects cellular aging processes. Another group will practice intermittent fasting, going without food for 24 hours three times each week. The final group will receive both rapamycin and intermittent fasting.\n\nThroughout the study, researchers will monitor the mice's health and record how long they live. They want to determine whether rapamycin, intermittent fasting, or a combination of both approaches is most effective at promoting healthy aging.\n\nThis research could lead to new treatments or lifestyle recommendations for humans. Understanding how these interventions affect aging might help develop strategies to extend not just how long people live, but how many of those years are spent in good health, free from age-related diseases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION\n\n### Research Objectives\nThis study aims to compare the efficacy of rapamycin, intermittent fasting, and their combination on lifespan and healthspan in laboratory mice. The research addresses critical questions about aging interventions that could translate to human therapeutic applications.\n\n### Scientific Background\nAging is characterized by progressive decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases. Two promising interventions have emerged from aging research:\n\n1. **Rapamycin:** An mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor that has demonstrated lifespan extension in multiple species through modulation of cellular growth, metabolism, and autophagy pathways.\n\n2. **Intermittent Fasting:** A dietary intervention that promotes metabolic flexibility, enhances stress resistance, and activates longevity pathways similar to caloric restriction.\n\n### Research Questions\n- Does rapamycin extend lifespan and healthspan in a dose-dependent manner?\n- Is intermittent fasting effective for promoting healthy aging in mice?\n- Do rapamycin and intermittent fasting have synergistic effects when combined?\n- What are the optimal intervention strategies for maximizing both lifespan and healthspan?\n\n### Expected Outcomes\nThis research will provide critical data on the comparative effectiveness of these aging interventions and inform future clinical translation strategies for human longevity research.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
